# Week 2: Client Consultation and Project Planning

During the second week of the project, our main focus is to understand the clients' requirements and set up a clear project plan. This document provides an overview of our progress and tasks for Week 2.

## Objectives

1. Establish communication channels with the clients.
2. Understand the clients' needs and expectations.
3. Determine the available resources and constraints.
4. Develop a project timeline and assign tasks to team members.
5. Set up the project repository and documentation structure.
6. Brainstorm different approaches for the project, including pipelines, data processing, and potential solutions.
7. Discuss the pros and cons of each approach and agree on one or a combination of the most beneficial strategies.

### Questions for Clients

1. What software and hardware resources are available for this project?
    Aï¼š Seek for college support.
2. Is there a budget allocated for additional resources (e.g., cloud computing services, data storage)?
    A: Refer to the college for budget allocation and support.
3. What are the expected deliverables and performance metrics for the final model? What should the finished product look like? UI, command line interaction, API?
    A: No specific requirement
4. How would you like us to prioritize the different aspects of the project, such as accuracy, speed, interpretability, or ease of integration? Are there any thresholds the project needs to meet?
    A: Focus on enriching the dataset using various methods and designing algorithms that work best with limited datasets.
5. Are there any specific data formats, platforms, or tools that the clients prefer to work with?
    A: No specific requirement.
6. What is the desired level of interpretability for the model?
    A: Interpretability for professionals.
7. Are there any privacy or security requirements for handling the data?
    A: Avoid using data with attached identities, and do not share the source code with people outside the team.
8. What is the desired frequency of progress updates and communication throughout the project?
    A: Communicate as desired; clients are open to informal conversations (e.g., via WhatsApp).

# Client Side:
1. Dataset
The main challenge is the dataset size. With many existing algorithms available online, the primary focus should be on enriching the dataset in terms of volume and variety. The client suggested some techniques:
Data Augmentation - Enlarge Sample Set
GAN (Generative adversarial network) - Generate Samples
Diffusion Models - Generate Samples

2. Algorithms
Suitable algorithms can make the most out of a limited dataset, generalizing well across different data qualities. The client suggested some techniques:
Vision Transformers - Attention is all you need
ROI(Region of interest) - Focus on suspicious regions
Segmentation - Similar to ROI but more challenging and effectiveeffective
Combination of two or more techniques

## Next Steps

- Collect and explore mammography data for model development and brainstorm approaches to achieve the goal..
- Begin data preprocessing and model design.
