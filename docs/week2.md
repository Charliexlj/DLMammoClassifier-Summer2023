# Week 2: Client Consultation and Project Planning

During the first week of the project, our main focus is to understand the clients' requirements and set up a clear project plan. This document provides an overview of our progress and tasks for Week 1.

## Objectives

1. Establish communication channels with the clients.
2. Understand the clients' needs and expectations.
3. Determine the available resources and constraints.
4. Develop a project timeline and assign tasks to team members.
5. Set up the project repository and documentation structure.

### Questions for Clients

1. What software and hardware resources are available for this project?
2. Is there a budget allocated for additional resources (e.g., cloud computing services, data storage)?
3. What are the expected deliverables and performance metrics for the final model? What should the finished product look like? UI, command line interaction, API?
4. How would you like us to prioritize the different aspects of the project, such as accuracy, speed, interpretability, or ease of integration? Are there any thresholds the project needs to meet?
5. Are there any specific data formats, platforms, or tools that the clients prefer to work with?
6. What is the desired level of interpretability for the model?
7. Are there any privacy or security requirements for handling the data?
8. What is the desired frequency of progress updates and communication throughout the project?

(Add more questions as needed.)

## Next Steps

- Collect and explore mammography data for model development.
- Begin data preprocessing and model design.
